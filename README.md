# iLearn ImageToPDF

I wrote this program because there was a class on iLearn at my college that had uploaded all the individual pages of the course material as separate JPEG files. I found this wildly inconveinent, so I wrote this program to automatically compile these images into PDFs corresponding to each unit. This probably won't be useful for anyone other than myself or people in this particular class, but I figured it's a good showcase project.

I utilized the Selenium library to programatically control Chrome, as well as PdfSharp to compile Base64 image strings into PDF documents.
